Seawater Aquarium Business Intelligence (sabi) aims to gain insights from aquarium hobbyist for aquarium hobbyist according seawater measures.

## Vision

In seawater forums, wikis, books we got advice on the regular values (max,min) of the important mineral levels and so on.
Some thinks we fully understand, while on others we have just a lot of guesses on the impact, but often it stays a guess, as the complete system is very complex.
I was wondering, if we will be able to gain some more insight if we start to share our measurement data. And place some business intelligence like
reporting on top of it. This should enable to to answer some questions like:

* How often do all measure the KH-Value, when not using the Balling method?
* Is there a thing in common when Alveoproa dies (are there similar PO4 levels)?

There must be quite a lot of interesting questions, especially in the field of aquaristic forensics.

So this is the project to build a platform, which helps to answer them.

## Technology Stack

### Client site
As you desire, the server API will be open, so that everyone might develop their own client or interface their existing product
against sabi. However to start with this project involves a

* GWT based WebClient

### Server side
* JEE
* REST
* JPA
* Glassfish
* MySQL or MariaDB
