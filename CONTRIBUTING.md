# There are different ways to contribute:

## As a User

### Adding features
You are missing a feature? Just create a new Issue for this project. Please use an agile form when writing a new story like
"As 'ROLE' I require 'FEATURE/FUNCTION' to have 'DESIRED_BENEFIT'." Or in case you want to file a bug, it would be good if you provide as much information that is required to reproduce the bug.

### Browse other users issues an vote them
If you are interested in sugested issues from other users too, give it a smily (githubs 'like it' button).
Those with the highest count have better chanced for being scheduled for the next release.

## As a Developer

### Branching, Merging
Please work along the issue log and create feature-branches and use pull requests. 
Don't start huge refactorings especially on architectural design (those are only accepted if we agree upon them, 
i.e. you need to communicate as in real life ;-) )

### Supporting
Look especially for features marked with "HELP WANTED"

## As a Sponsor

Any support in terms of infrastructure, software licences or donations are welcome.
I plan to integrate a sponsor splash screen or something like this.
