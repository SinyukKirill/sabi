# There are two ways to contribute:

## As a user
You are missing a feature? Just create a new Issue for this project. Please use an agile form when writing a new story like
"As <role> I require <Function> to have <value>." Or in case you want to file a bug, it would be good if you provide as much
information that is required to reproduce the bug.

## As a developer
Please work along the issue log and create feature-branches and use pull requests. 
Don't start huge refactorings especially on architectural design (those are only accepted if we agree upon them, 
i.e. you need to communicate as in real life ;-) )
